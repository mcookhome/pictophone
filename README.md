PICTOPHONE - http://45.55.183.87:8000

## Description
Pictophone.
An online game in which players take turns alternating between drawing a picture and writing a sentence.
For example, Player 1 writes a sentence describing a scene, then Player 2 draws the scene. Player 3 only 
sees the scene Player 2 drew, and writes a sentence. Player 4 draws a picture based on the sentence Player 3 
wrote and the game goes on. It is designed to simply be funny, not a competetive game.
